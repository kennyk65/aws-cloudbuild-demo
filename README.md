This is just a sample Java / Maven / Spring Cloud project I'm using to test out AWS CodeBuild              
    
Example of a simple web app that shows the instance environment.    
- Demonstrates basic usage of a Spring Cloud AWS web app     
- Uses Spring Cloud AWS to obtain EC2 instance metadata when running in AWS.         
- Behaves nicely when running outside of AWS    
- Show actuator     
- Thymeleaf is used for web pages      
- Bootstrap is used for formatting.    
   
Snuh!
