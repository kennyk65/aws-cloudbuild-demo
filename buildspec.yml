# This is a configuration file for AWS CodeBuild.  It just runs maven.        
# The test phase is run separately from the package phase, just to enable splitting later.  
# The output file is identified by its name only (getting rid of 'target' on the path), which means it will 
# show up later in the S3 bucket with just its name and no pathing.
